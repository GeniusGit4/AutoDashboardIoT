# ðŸš— Car Dashboard with CAN & IoT Integration

An advanced embedded system designed to collect, process, and visualize real-time vehicle and environmental data using multiple sensors and robust communication protocols. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of automotive-grade embedded software with both local OLED visualization and cloud-based monitoring for enhanced safety, analytics, and user experience.

ðŸ”§ Project Overview
* Developed in Embedded C for STM32 microcontrollers using STM32CubeIDE.
* Utilizes FreeRTOS for efficient multitasking and reliable sensor data handling.
* Real-time acquisition from multiple sensors: ultrasonic, temperature (LM35, DHT11), air quality (MQ-135), and speed measurement.
* Data transmitted via CAN bus protocol for robust, synchronized inter-device communication.
* Local feedback through an OLED display with animated graphical gauges and alerts for real-time driver awareness.
* Remote monitoring enabled via Blynk Cloud for data logging, graphs, and dashboards accessible from anywhere.
* Designed for modularity, reliability, and real-time performance across both hardware and software layers.
